    "Steve doubting if startup worth the stress - 'Your father's body is breaking from 35 years of labor. This is why you're building equity. So his doesn't have to anymore.'",
    "Steve needs reminder what matters - 'Carlos didn't want Maria to call you from ambulance. Didn't want to worry you. That's who he is. Win for him.'"
