## Additional Terms for the Ancillary Standard

The **Ancillary Standard** (as defined in ANCILLARY-STANDARD-v1.0.md) is 
released under the MIT License with the following clarifications:

### Data Sovereignty Principle

While the standard and code are freely available under MIT, implementations 
MUST respect user data sovereignty:

1. **User Data Ownership**: Manifests created by users belong to those users, 
   not to service providers or platform operators.

2. **Export Rights**: Any compliant implementation MUST provide users the 
   ability to export their complete manifest set in human-readable JSON format.

3. **No Training Without Consent**: Service providers MUST NOT use user 
   manifests as training data for AI models without explicit additional consent.

4. **Portability**: Users MUST be able to migrate their manifests to any other 
   compliant implementation without loss of data or continuity.

### Compliance Marking

Implementations claiming "Ancillary Standard v1.0 Compliant" MUST:
- Implement all required features as defined in ANCILLARY-STANDARD-v1.0.md
- Respect the data sovereignty principles above
- Pass the compliance test suite (when available)

### Freedom to Fork and Compete

This license explicitly encourages:
- Forking this repository
- Creating competing implementations
- Improving upon the standard
- Building commercial services using the standard

**We want competition on craft, not lock-in.**

### No Warranty, But Principles Matter

While this software is provided "as is" without warranty, the principles of 
data sovereignty, user ownership, and platform independence are foundational 
to the Ancillary vision. Implementations that violate these principles may 
technically comply with MIT but philosophically contradict the standard's purpose.

---

**In short:**

Take this code. Build with it. Compete with it. Make it better.

Just don't trap users. Ever.

That's the deal.
