  "company_overview": {
    "legal_name": "Nexus AI, Inc.",
    "founded": "June 2023",
    "founders": ["Steve Castellano (CEO)", "Sarah Chen (CTO)"],
    "location": "Austin, Texas",
    "incorporation": "Delaware C-Corp",

  "elevator_pitch": {
    "one_line": "Nexus automates repetitive workflows for non-technical teams using AI that learns how your team actually works.",
    "problem": "Non-technical teams (HR, operations, sales ops, customer success) spend 40% of their time on repetitive tasks: data entry, status updates, report generation, cross-tool copying. Existing automation tools require technical expertise or rigid templates that break when processes change.",
    "solution": "Nexus uses ML to observe how teams work, then suggests and implements automations without requiring coding or rigid setup. The AI learns your team's patterns and adapts when workflows change.",
    "differentiation": [
      "No-code setup - non-technical users can implement automations in minutes",
      "Adaptive learning - AI adjusts when processes change, doesn't break like Zapier",
      "Context-aware - understands team workflows holistically, not just individual task automation",
      "Built for operations teams - designed for HR, sales ops, customer success, not just engineers"
    ],
    "target_customer": "Mid-market companies (50-500 employees), operations teams drowning in repetitive work, buying champions are typically ops managers or directors"

  "product_details": {
    "v1.0_launched_sept_2023": {
      "features": [
        "Workflow observation - connects to team's tools (Slack, Notion, Airtable, Salesforce, etc.), observes patterns",
        "Automation suggestions - AI identifies repetitive tasks, suggests automations",
        "One-click implementation - non-technical users approve suggested automations without coding",
        "Basic analytics - tracks time saved, automations running, team adoption"
      ],
      "tech_stack": "Python backend (FastAPI), React frontend, PostgreSQL + Redis, AWS deployment",
      "architecture": "Microservices, event-driven, built for scale by Sarah",

        "Better accuracy - new models trained on 18 months of customer data, 40% fewer irrelevant suggestions",
        "Real-time sync - changes propagate across tools instantly instead of 5-minute delay",
        "Improved UI - complete redesign based on user feedback, cleaner and more intuitive",
        "Team collaboration features - shared automation libraries, approval workflows for managers"
      ],
      "technical_complexity": "significant rebuild, not just feature additions - new ML models, new infrastructure, new frontend",
      "alex_kim_critical": "Alex owns 40% of v2.0 codebase, losing him would delay launch by 3+ months",
