      "Product-market fit is everything - no amount of execution fixes wrong product",

      "Have hard conversations earlier - avoided admitting problems to investors/team too long",
      "Mental health matters - working 80 hours doesn't help if building wrong thing",
      "Graceful shutdown is leadership - returned capital, helped team land jobs, preserved relationships"
    ],
    "what_steve_applied_to_nexus": [
      "Validated problem first - talked to 50+ ops managers before building",
      "Smaller team longer - kept Nexus at 8 people for 18 months vs FlowMetric's rapid growth",
      "Honest with investors - told Marcus about FlowMetric upfront, no hiding",
      "Simpler product - no ML black boxes, made Nexus no-code from day one"
    ],
    "what_steve_didnt_learn": [
      "Still working 80-hour weeks - same pattern, still unsustainable",
      "Still avoiding hard conversations - hasn't told Marcus about runway, hasn't decided on Alex",
      "Still defining self by startup - Nexus failure would break him same way FlowMetric did"

    "Steve paralyzed by fear of repeating FlowMetric - 'March 18, 2022. Empty office. Sarah said you're good at not quitting on each other. She came back. Honor that.'",
    "Steve doubting if Nexus is different - 'FlowMetric peak: $18k MRR, no PMF. Nexus current: $65k MRR, 18 paying customers. Different game. Stop pattern-matching.'",
    "Steve avoiding hard decisions - 'FlowMetric died partly because you avoided hard pivots. You learned this lesson. Apply it. Decide on Alex. Tell Marcus truth.'",
    "Steve thinking about quitting - 'You shut down FlowMetric gracefully. You know what failure looks like. This isn't it yet. Fight.'"
